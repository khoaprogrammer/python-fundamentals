Hi. My name is Austin Bingham. Welcome to the second module of the Python Fundamentals course, which is

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
about strings, collections, and iteration with for-loops.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Python includes a rich selection of collection types, which are often completely sufficient for even

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
quite intricate programs without resorting to defining our own data structures.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We'll give enough of an overview of some fundamental collection types now, enough to allow us to write

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
some interesting code. We'll also be revisiting each of these collection types together with a few additional

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
ones later in the course. Let's start with these types str, bytes, list, and dict.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Along the way we'll also cover Python's for-loops.
