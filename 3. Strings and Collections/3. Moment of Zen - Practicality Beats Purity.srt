At first sight, support for both quoting styles seems to violate an important principle of Pythonic style

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
from The Zen of Python. There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it.

In this case, however, another aphorism from the same source, practicality beats purity, takes precedence.

The utility of supporting two quoting styles is valued more highly than the alternative, a single quoting

style combined with more frequent use of ugly escape sequences, which we'll encounter shortly.
