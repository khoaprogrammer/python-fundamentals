00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Dictionaries are completely fundamental to the way the Python language works and are very widely used.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A dictionary maps keys to values and in some languages is known as an associate of array.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's look at how to create and use them in Python.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Literal dictionaries are created using curly braces containing key value pairs.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Each pair is separated by a comma, and each key is separated from the corresponding value by a colon.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here we use a dictionary to create a simple telephone directory.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We can retrieve items by key using the square brackets operator and update the values associated with

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the key by assigning through the square brackets. If we assign to a key that has not yet been added, a new

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
entry is created. Be aware that the entries in the dictionary can't be relied upon to be stored in any particular

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
order. Similarly to lists, empty dictionaries can be created using empty curly braces.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We'll revisit dictionaries in much more detail in Module 5.
