Strings in Python have the data type str spelled S-T-R, and we've been using them extensively already.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Strings are sequences of Unicode codepoints, and for the most part you can think of codepoints as being

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
like characters, although they aren't strictly equivalent. The sequence of characters in a Python string

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is immutable meaning that once you've constructed a string you can't modify its contents.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Literal strings in Python are delimited by quotes. You can use single quotes or double quotes.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You must, however, be consistent. For example, you can't do this.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Supporting both quoting styles allows you to easily incorporate the other quote characters into the

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
literal string without resorting to ugly escape character gymnastics.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Notice that the REPL exploits the same quoting flexibility when echoing the strings back to us.
