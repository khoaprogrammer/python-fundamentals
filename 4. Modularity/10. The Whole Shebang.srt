00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And now the whole shebang. It's common on Unix-like systems to have the first line of a script

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
include a special comment called a shebang. This begins with the usual hash as for any other comment

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
followed by an exclamation mark. The shebang allows the program loader to identify which interpreter should

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
be used to run the program. Shebangs have an additional purpose of conveniently documenting at the top of a

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
file whether the Python code they're in is Python 2 or Python 3. The exact details of your shebang command

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
depend on the location of Python on your system. Typical Python 3 shebangs use the Unix env program to

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
locate Python 3 on your path environment variable, which importantly is compatible with Python virtual environments.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A standard Python 3 shebang passes Python 3 to the user bin/env program.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't worry if you're on Windows. Python includes machinery to make this work on Windows too.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
On Mac or Linux, we must mark our script as executable using the chmod command before the shebang will have

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
any effect. Having done that, we can now run our script directly.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Since Python 3.3, Python on Windows also supports the use of the shebang to make Python scripts directly

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
executable with a correct version of the Python interpreter, even to the extent that shebangs that look like

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
they should only work on Unix-like systems will work as expected on Windows.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This works because Windows Python distributions now use a program called PyLauncher.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
PyLauncher, the executable for which is simply py.exe, will pass the shebang and locate the appropriate

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
version of Python on your system.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
For example, on Windows in cmd shell, simply words.py followed by the URL as the command line argument will

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
be sufficient to run your script with Python 3, even if you also have Python 2 installed.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You can read more about PyLauncher on windows in PEP 397.
