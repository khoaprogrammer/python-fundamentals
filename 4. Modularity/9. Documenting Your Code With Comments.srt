00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next, we'll introduce Python code comments.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We believe docstrings are the right place for most documentation Python code.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They explain how to consume the facilities your module provides rather than how it works.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ideally, your code should be clean enough that ancillary explanation is not required.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Nevertheless, it's sometimes necessary to explain why a particular approach has been chosen or a particular

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
technique used. And we can do that using Python comments. Comments in Python begin with a hash symbol and

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
continue to the end of the line. Let's document the fact that it might not be immediately obvious why we are

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
using sys.argv(1) rather than sys.argv(0). This is because the 0th argument of sys.argv is the module filename.
