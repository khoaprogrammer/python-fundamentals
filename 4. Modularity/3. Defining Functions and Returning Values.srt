00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's quickly define a few functions at the REPL to get the idea. Functions are defined using the def

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
keyword followed by the function name, an argument list in parentheses, and a colon to start a new block.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We use the return keyword to return a value form the function. As we've seen previously, we call functions

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
by providing the actual arguments in parentheses, if there are any, after the function name.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Functions aren't required to explicitly return a value though. Perhaps they produce side effects.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You can return early from a function by using the return keyword with no parameter.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A return keyword without a parameter, or the implicit return at the end of a function, actually causes the

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
function to return None, although remember that the REPL doesn't display None results, so we don't see them.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
By capturing the returned object into a named variable, we can test for None.
