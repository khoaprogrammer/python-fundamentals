00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You may have noticed that our top-level functions have two blank lines between them.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is conventional for modern Python code.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Sparse is better than dense. Two between functions, that is the number of lines PEP 8 recommends.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
According to the PEP 8 style guide, it's customary to use two blank lines between module level functions.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We find this convention has served us well making code easier to navigate.
