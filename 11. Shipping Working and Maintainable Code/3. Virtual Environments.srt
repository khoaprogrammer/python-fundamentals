00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Before we move onto the next sections, we need to quickly look at how to create a virtual environment for Python.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A virtual environment is a light-weight, self-contained Python installation that users can create without

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
needing administrator rights on their system. If you're using Python 3.3, then you should already have

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a tool called pyvenv installed on your system.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You can verify this by running it from the command line. If you don't have pyvenv installed, there is another

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
tool, virtualenv, that you can get from the Python package index.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This works very similarly. You can use either pyvenv or virtualenv in this course, and we'll use pyvenv

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
for the examples. Using pyvenv is very simple. You simply specify the directory to contain your new virtual

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
environment. The tool creates the new directory and populates it with the installation.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Once the environment is created, you can activate it by using the activate script in the environment's

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
bin directory. On Linux or Mac OS X you have to source the script.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
On Windows you simply run it. Once you do this, your prompt will change to remind you that you're in the virtual

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
environment, and most importantly the Python that will execute when you run Python is from the virtual

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
environment. We'll be using virtual environments in the following sections, so make sure you can create

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
them before moving on.
