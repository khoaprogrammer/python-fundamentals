00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Concatenating lists using the addition operator results in a new list without modification of the operands

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
whereas the augmented assignment operator += modifies the assignee in place.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This can also be achieved using the extend() list method. All of these techniques work with any iterable

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
series, not just lists on the right hand side.
