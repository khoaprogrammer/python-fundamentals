Hi. My name is Robert Smallshire. Welcome to the fifth module of the Python Fundamentals course where

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we look in more depth at the built-in collection types of the Python language and explore the various protocols

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that unite them.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In this module we'll revisit some collection types we've already explored:

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Str or string, the immutable sequence of Unicode codepoints; list, the mutable sequence of objects;

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and dict, the mutable mapping from immutable keys to mutable objects.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We'll also cover some new ones: Tuple, the immutable sequence of objects; range for arithmetic progressions

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of integers; and set, a mutable collection of unique immutable objects.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We won't cover the bytes type further here. We've already discussed its essential differences with str,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and most of what we learned about str can also be applied to bytes.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is not an exhaustive list of Python collection types, but it's completely sufficient for the overwhelming

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
majority of Python 3 programs you'll encounter in the wild or are likely to write yourself.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In this module we'll be covering these collections in this order, and then round off with an overview of

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the protocols that unite these collections, which allow them to be used in consistent and predictable ways.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
First up is tuple.
