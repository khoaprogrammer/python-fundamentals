1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To find an element in a list, use the index method passing the object you're searching for.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The elements are compared for equivalence or value equality until the one you're looking for is found

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and its index returned. Here we create a list W containing the words the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
dog using the string split method. Searching for fox using the index method returns the integer 3, which

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
of course allows us to get ahold of that element. If you search for a value that isn't present like unicorn,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you will receive a ValueError, which we'll learn how to handle gracefully in the next module.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Another means of searching is to count matching elements using the count method.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here we count occurrences of the word the. If you just want to test for membership, you can use the in operator

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or for nonmembership using the not in operator.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Elements are removed from lists using a keyword with which we have not yet become acquainted, del.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The del keyword takes a single parameter, which is a reference to a list element and removes it from the

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
list shortening the list in the process. Here we make a string U containing the words jackdaws love my big

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
sphinx of quartz using the string split method. We can delete the fourth element using del u(3) leaving

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
jackdaws love my sphinx of quartz. It's also possible to remove elements by value rather than by position

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
using the remove method. Here we pass jackdaws to that method giving us love my sphinx of quartz.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is of course equivalent to using the del statement and the index method in combination.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Attempting to remove an item which is not present such as pyramid results in a ValueError.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Items can be inserted into lists using the insert method, which accepts the index of the new item and the

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
new item itself. Here we create a list A containing the words I accidently the whole universe.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We insert the word destroyed at index 2 using a call to the insert method giving us I accidentally destroyed

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the whole universe. We can covert this list of words back into a string by calling the string join operator

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:59:00,000
on a space separator.
