1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This course is broken up into 10 separate modules. The modules build on one another, so unless you've already

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
had some exposure to Python you'll need to follow them in order.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We'll start with getting Python installed onto your system and orienting you a bit.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We'll then cover language elements, features, idioms, and libraries all driven by working examples

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that you'll be able to build along with the lecture. We're firm believers that you'll learn more by doing

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
than just by watching, so we encourage you to run the examples yourself.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
By the end of the course, you'll know the fundamentals of the Python language.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You'll also know how to use third-party libraries, and you'll know the basics of developing them yourself.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We'll even show you how to package up your code to make it easier for others to use what you have written.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The course modules are: One, Getting Started, where we cover installing Python, look at some of the basic

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Python tools, and cover the core elements of the language and syntax.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Two, Strings and Collections, where we look at some of the fundamental complex data types, stings, byte

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
sequences, lists, and dictionaries. Three, Modularity, where we look at the tools Python has for structuring

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
your code such as functions and modules. Four, Built-in Types and the Object Model, where we examine Python's

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
type system and object system in detail and where we develop a strong sense of Python's reference semantics.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Five, Collection Types, where we go into more depth on some of the Python collection types, as well as introduce

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a few more. Six, Handling Exceptions, where we learn about Python's exception handling system and the

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
central role that exceptions play in the language. Seven, Comprehensions, Iterables, and Generators,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
where we explore the elegant, pervasive, and powerful sequence-oriented parts of the Python language

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
such as comprehensions and generator functions. Eight, Defining New Types with Classes, where we'll

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
cover developing your own complex data types in Python using classes to support object-oriented programming.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Nine, Files and Resource Management, where we'll look at how to work with files in Python and where we'll

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
cover the tools Python has for resource management. Finally ten, Shipping Working and Maintainable

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Code, where we'll show you how to use Python's testing, debugging, and code distribution facilities

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to produce code that works and can be used by others.
