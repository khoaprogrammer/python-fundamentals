Hello, and welcome to the first module of the Python Fundamentals course.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Austin Bingham, and over a series of modules I and Robert Smallshire will be guiding you through

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the basics of the Python programming language.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Python is a big language, and a single course can't possibly cover everything there is to know, but this

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
course will serve you well as a solid foundation for really mastering Python.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In this module, we'll give you a high-level overview of the Python language, what it is, and what's so great

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
about it. We'll also give you a bird's eye view of the rest of this course so that you'll have an idea of what's

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to come.
