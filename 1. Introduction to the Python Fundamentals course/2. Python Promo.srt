00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
First, what's so great about Python? Why do you want to learn it?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There are lots of good answers to those questions. One is

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that Python is powerful. The Python language is expressive and productive.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It comes with a great standard library, and it's the center of a huge universe of wonderful third-party

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
libraries. With Python you can build everything from simple scripts to complex applications, you can

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
do it quickly, you can do it safely, and you can do it with fewer lines of code than you might think possible.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But that's just part of what makes Python great.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Another is that Python is wonderfully open. It's open source, so you can get to know every aspect of it if

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you want. At the same time, Python is hugely popular and has a great community to support you when you run

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
into problems. This combination of openness and large user base means that almost anyone from casual

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
programmers to professional software developers can engage with the language at the level they need.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Another benefit of a large user base is that Python is showing up in more and more places.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You may be wanting to learn Python simply because it's the language of some technology you want to use,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and this is not surprising. Many of the most popular web and scientific packages in the world are written

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
in Python. But for many people these reasons take backseat to something more important.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Python is fun. Python's expressive readable style, quick edit and run development cycle, and batteries

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
included philosophy mean that you can sit down and enjoy writing code rather than fighting compilers

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and thorny syntax. And Python will grow with you. As your experiments become prototypes and your prototypes

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
become products, Python makes the experience of writing software not just easier, but truly enjoyable.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:59:00,000
In the words of Randall Munroe, "Come join us. Programming is fun again."
