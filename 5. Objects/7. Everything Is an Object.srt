00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In Python it's important to remember that everything is an object, primitive objects, functions, modules,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and on and on. It's easy to see that when you start to explore even simple pieces of code.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's go back to our words module and experiment with it further at the REPL.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
On this occasion we'll import just the module. The import statement binds a module object to the name words

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in the current namespace. We can determine the type of any object by using the type built-in function.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If we want to see the attributes of an object, we can use the dir built-in function in a Python interactive

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
session to introspect an object. The dir function returns a sorted list of the module attributes including

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the ones we defined such as the function fetch words, any imported names such as sys and urlopen, and various

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
special attributes delimited by double underscores such as double underscore name and double underscore

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
doc, which reveal the inner workings of Python. We can use the type function on any of these attributes

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to learn more about them. For instance, we can see that fetch_words is a function object.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We can in turn call dir on the function to reveal its attributes, and we see that function objects have many

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
special attributes to do with how Python functions are implemented behind the scenes.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
For now, we'll just look at a couple of simple attributes. As you might expect, this is the name of the function

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
object as a string, and this is the docstring we provided. These give us some clues as to how the built-in

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
help function might be implemented.
