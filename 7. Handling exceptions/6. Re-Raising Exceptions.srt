1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Instead of returning an unpythonic error code, we can simply omit our error message and re-raise the exception

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
object we're currently handling. This can be done by replacing the return -1 with raise at the end of our

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
exception handling block. Without a parameter, raise simply re-raises the exception that is being currently

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
handled.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Testing in the REPL, we can see that the original exception type is re-raised whether it's a ValueError

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
or a TypeError, but our conversion error message has printed a standard error along the way.
