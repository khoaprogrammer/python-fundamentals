00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's make our class a little more interesting by adding a so-called instance method, which returns the

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
flight number.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Methods are just functions defined within the class, and instance methods are functions which can be

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
called on objects or instances of our class such as F. Instance methods must accept a reference to the instance

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
on which the method was called as the first argument, and by convention this argument is always called self.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have no way of configuring the flight number value yet, so we'll just return a constant string.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now from a fresh REPL let's import that and see how it works.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Notice that when we call the method we do not provide the instance F for the actual argument itself in the

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
argument list. That's because the standard method invocation form with the dot is simply syntactic sugar

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
for the class name followed by a dot followed by the method name with the instance passed as the first argument.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you try the latter, you'll find that it works as expected, although you'll almost never see this form

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:59:00,000
used for real.
