00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Complex is better than complicated. Many moving parts combined in a cleaver box are now one good tool.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The aircraft model method is an example of complex is better than complicated.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The flight class is more complex, that is it contains additional code to drill down through the aircraft

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
reference to find the model; however, all clients of flight can now be less complicated.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
None of them need to know about the aircraft class, dramatically simplifying the system.
