00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The Law of Demeter is an object-oriented design principle that says you should never call methods on objects

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you receive from other calls, or put another way, only talk to your friends.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll modify our flight class to accept an aircraft object when it's constructed, and we'll follow the

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Law of Demeter by adding a method to report the aircraft model.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This method will delegate to aircraft on behalf of the client rather than allowing the client to reach

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
through the flight and interrogate the aircraft object directly.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We also add a docstring to the class. These work just like function and module docstrings.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We can now construct a flight with a specific aircraft. Notice that we construct the aircraft object and

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
directly pass it to the flight constructor without needing an intermediate named reference for it.
