00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Simple is better than complex. Code is written once, but read over and over.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Fewer is clearer. Comprehensions are often more readable than the alternative; however, it's possible

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to overuse comprehensions. Sometimes a long or complex comprehension may be less readable than the equivalent

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
for loop. There's no hard and fast rule about when one form should be preferred, but be conscientious when

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
writing your code, and try to choose the best form for your situation.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Above all, your comprehension should ideally be purely functional.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That is, they should have no side effects. If you need to create side effects such as printing to the console

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
during iteration, use another construct such as a for loop instead.
