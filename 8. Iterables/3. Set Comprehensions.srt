1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Set support is similar comprehension syntax using, as you might expect,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
curly braces instead of square brackets, and number of digits in factorial's result contain duplicates.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
By building a set instead, we can eliminate them, although note that the resulting set is not necessarily

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:59:00,000
stored in a meaningful order since sets are unordered containers.
