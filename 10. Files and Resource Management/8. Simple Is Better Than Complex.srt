Beautiful is better than ugly. Sugary syntax, fewer defects attained through sweet fidelity.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The with-block syntax is so-called syntactic sugar

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
for a much more complex arrangement of try/except and try/finally blocks.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Few of us would want our code to look this convoluted, but for it to be reliable this is how it would need to

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:59:00,000
look without the with statement. Sugar may not be good for your health, but it can be very healthy for your code.
