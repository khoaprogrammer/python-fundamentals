Sometimes we would like to append to an existing file. We can do that by opening the file with mode A, which

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
opens the file for writing, appending to the end of the file if it already exists.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In this example we combine that with T to be explicit about using text mode.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Although there is no writeline method in Python, there is a writelines method, which writes an iterable

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
series of strings to a stream. If you want line endings on your strings, you must provide them yourself.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This seems odd at first, but it preserves symmetry with readlines whilst also giving us the flexibility

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of using writelines to write any iterable series of strings to a file.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Notice that only three lines are completed in this example. I say completed because the file we're appending

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to doesn't end with a newline.
