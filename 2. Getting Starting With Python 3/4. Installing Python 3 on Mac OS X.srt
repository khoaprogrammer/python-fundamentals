Now we'll demonstrate how to install Python 3 on Mac OS X.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For Mac OS X, you need to visit the official Python website that's python.org.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Head to the Download page by clicking the link on the left. On the Download page, find the Mac OS X installer

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:45,000
matching your version of Mac OS X, and click the link to download it.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A DMG disk image file downloads, which you open from your download stack or from the finder.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In the finder window that opens, you'll see the file Python.mpkg, a multi-package installer file.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Use the secondary click action to open the context menu for that file.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
From that menu select Open. On some version of Mac OS X you'll now be told that the file is from an unidentified

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
developer. Press the Open button on this dialog to continue with the installation.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You are now in the Python Installer program. Follow the directions clicking through the wizard.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There's no need to customize the install, and you should keep the standard settings.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
When it's available, click the Install button to install Python.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You may be asked for your password to authorize the installation.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Once the installation completes, click Close to close the installer.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now that Python 3 is installed, open a Terminal window and verify that you can run Python 3 from the command line.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Welcome to Python! The triple arrow prompt shows that Python is waiting for your input.
