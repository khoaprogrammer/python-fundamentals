Now we'll demonstrate how to install Python 3 on Ubuntu Linux.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
To install Python on Linux, you'll want to use your system's package manager.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For this course, we'll show how to install Python on a recent version of Ubuntu, but the process is very

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
similar on most other modern Linux distributions. On Unbuntu, first start the Ubuntu Software Center.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This can usually be run by clicking its icon in the launcher.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Alternatively, you can run it from the dashboard by searching on Ubuntu Software Center and clicking

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the selection. Once you're in the Software Center, enter the search term Python 3.3 in the search bar in

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the upper right hand corner and press Return. One of the results you get will say Python (v3.3) with Python

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
interpreter at 3.3 in smaller type beneath it. Select this entry, and click the Install button that appears.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You may need to enter your password to install the software at this point.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You should now see a progress indicator appear, which will disappear when the installation is complete.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Open a terminal using Control+Alt+T, and verify that you can run Python 3.3 from the command line.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Welcome to Python! The triple arrow prompt shows that Python is waiting for your input.
