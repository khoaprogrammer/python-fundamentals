Welcome to the Python Fundamentals course by Robert Smallshire and Austin Bingham.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Robert Smallshire, and I'll be presenting this Getting Started module of the Python Fundamentals

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
course.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In this module we'll cover obtaining and installing Python on your system for Windows, Ubuntu Linux,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and Mac OS X. We'll write some basic Python code and become acquainted with the essentials of Python programming

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
culture such as The Zen of Python, although never forgetting the origins of the name of the language.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There are two major versions of the Python language, Python 2, which is the widely deployed legacy language,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and Python 3, which is the present and future of the language.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Most Python code will work without modification between the last version of Python 2, which is Python

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
2.7, and recent versions of Python 3 such as Python 3.3. However, there are some key differences, and in

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a strict sense the languages are incompatible. We'll be using Python 3.3 for this course, but we'll point

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
out key differences with Python 2 as we go. It's also very likely that this being a fundamentals course

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
everything we present will apply to future versions of Python 3, so don't be afraid to try those as they

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
become available.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Before we can start programming in Python, we need to get ahold of a Python environment.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Python is a highly portable language available on all major operating systems.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You'll be able to complete this course on Windows, Mac, or Linux, and the only major section where we diverge

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
into platform specifics is coming right up as we install Python 3.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
As we cover the three platforms, feel free to skip over the sections which aren't relevant for you.
