00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Bool values are commonly produced by Python's relational operators, which can be used for comparing objects.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The relational operators are sometimes called the comparison operators.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
These include value equality and inequality, less-than, greater-than, less-than or equal to, and greater-

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
than or equal to. Two of the most widely used relational operators are Python's equality and inequality

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
tests, which actually test for equivalence or inequivalence of values.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That is two objects are equivalent if one could be used in place of the other.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll learn more about the notion of object equivalence later in the course.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For now, we'll simply compare integers.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's start by assigning or binding a value to a variable g. We test for equality with a double equals operator

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
or for inequality using the not equals operator. We can also compare the order of quantity using the so-

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:21,000
called rich comparison operators less-than, greater-than, less-than or equal to, and greater-than

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:59:00,000
or equal to.
