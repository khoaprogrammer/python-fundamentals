00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now we'll demonstrate how to install Python 3 on Windows.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For Windows you'll need to visit the official Python website at python.org and then head to the Download

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
page by clicking on the link to the left. For Windows you should choose one of the MSI Installers depending

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:45,000
on whether you're running on a 32- or 64-bit platform. Download and run the installer.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In the installer decide whether you want to install Python only for yourself or for all users, and choose

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
a location for the Python distribution. The defaults will be in Python33 in the root of the C drive.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We don't recommend installing Python into program files because the virtualized file store used to isolate

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
applications from each other in Windows Vista and above can interfere with easily installing third-

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
party Python packages. On the Customize Python page of the wizard, we recommend keeping the defaults,

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
which use less than 40 MB of space. In addition to installing the Python runtime standard library, the

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
installer will register various file types such as PY files with the Python interpreter.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Once Python has been installed, you'll need to add Python to your system path environment variable.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
To do this, from the Control Panel choose System and Security and then System.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Using the test pane on the left choose advanced system settings to open the advanced tab of the System Properties

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
dialog. Click Environment Variables to open the child dialog.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you have administrative privileges, you should be able to add the path's Python33 and Python33\Scripts

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to the semicolon separated list of entries associated with the path system variable.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If not, you should be able to create or append to a path variable specific to your user containing the same value.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Click OK once, twice, and three times to exit the dialogs.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now open a new console window, either PowerShell or CMD will work fine, and verify that you can run Python

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
from the command line. Welcome to Python! The triple arrow prompt shows you that Python is waiting for

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
your input. At this point you might want to skip forward while we show you how to install Python on Linux

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and Mac.
