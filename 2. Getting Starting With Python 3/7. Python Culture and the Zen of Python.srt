00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Many programming languages are at the center of a cultural movement.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They have their own communities, values, practices, and philosophy, and Python is no exception.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The development of the Python language itself is managed through a series of documents called Python

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Enhancement Proposals or PEPs. One of the PEPs called PEP 8 explains how you should format your code, and

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
we follow its guidelines throughout this course. It is PEP 8 which recommends we use four spaces for indentation

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
in new Python code. Another of these PEPs called PEP 20 is called The Zen of Python.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It refers to 20 aphorisms describing the guiding principles of Python, only 19 of which have been written down.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Conveniently, The Zen of Python is never further away than the nearest Python interpreter as it can always

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
be accessed from the REPL by typing import this. Throughout this course, we'll be highlighting particular

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
negative wisdom from The Zen of Python in moments of Zen to understand how they apply to what we have learned.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:26,000
As we've just introduced Python significant indentation, this is a good time for our first moment.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Readability counts. Clarity matters. So, readability makes for valuable code.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
In time you'll come to appreciate Python's significant whitespace for the elegance it brings to your

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
code and these with which you can read others.
